# ECS Task Protection - Gap Prevention Implementation

## Overview

The ECS Task Protection system has been implemented with gap-free lease extension to ensure tasks cannot be terminated while critical processing is in progress. The protection only ends when explicitly self-invoked by the application.

## Gap Prevention Mechanism

### Timing Configuration

- **Check Interval**: 60 seconds - How often the protection manager checks for critical sessions
- **Extension Interval**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) - Base protection duration  
- **Protection Buffer**: 120 seconds (2 minutes) - Additional safety margin
- **Gap Safety Margin**: 60 seconds (Buffer - Check Interval) - Prevents timing gaps

### How Gap Prevention Works

1. **Initial Protection**: When a critical session starts, protection is enabled for `Extension Interval + Buffer` = 420 seconds
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Background thread checks every 60 seconds for critical sessions
3. **Proactive Extension**: Before expiration, protection is extended for another 420 seconds
4. **Safety Margin**: The 60-second gap safety margin prevents any timing gaps between extensions

### Visual Timeline

```
Time:     0s    60s   120s   180s   240s   300s   360s   420s   480s
Check:    ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓
Expires:  |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|✗    |
Extended: |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|✓------>
          [--- 420s protection period ---] [--- 420s extended ---]
                                    ^                ^
                              Check at 360s    Extend before expiry
```

## Self-Invoked Shutdown

### Normal Shutdown Flow

1. **Critical Session Completes**: Application calls `session.set_critical(False)`
2. **Session Removal**: Critical session is removed from the protection manager
3. **Automatic Disable**: Background thread detects no critical sessions and disables protection
4. **Safe Termination**: Task can now be safely terminated by ECS

### Signal Handling

When SIGTERM/SIGINT is received:

1. **Check Critical Sessions**: Determine if any critical processing is active
2. **Defer Shutdown**: If critical sessions exist, defer shutdown and log protection status
3. **Continue Protection**: ECS task protection prevents premature termination
4. **Natural Completion**: Wait for critical sessions to complete naturally
5. **Graceful Exit**: Only exit when no critical sessions remain

### Emergency Shutdown

For controlled application shutdown:

```python
# Force disable protection (emergency only)
task_protection_manager.force_disable_protection("Controlled shutdown")
```

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **ECSTaskProtectionManager**: Core protection logic with background monitoring
2. **ProcessingSession**: Application-level session management with critical state tracking
3. **Signal Handlers**: Graceful shutdown handling that respects critical processing
4. **Background Thread**: Continuous monitoring and gap-free lease extension

### Configuration Verification

The system automatically verifies that the configuration prevents gaps:

```python
gap_safety_margin = protection_buffer - check_interval
gap_protection_safe = gap_safety_margin > 0
```

### Status Monitoring

Real-time protection status includes:

- Critical sessions count and IDs
- Protection enabled/disabled state
- Gap safety margin calculation
- Time until protection expiry
- ECS availability status

## Testing Results

✅ **Gap Prevention**: Verified that lease extension prevents any timing gaps
✅ **Self-Invoked Shutdown**: Confirmed protection only ends when explicitly requested  
✅ **Critical Session Tracking**: Validated proper session lifecycle management
✅ **Signal Handling**: Tested graceful shutdown behavior with active critical sessions
✅ **Emergency Override**: Verified force disable capability for controlled shutdowns

## Usage Example

```python
# Start critical processing
session = create_processing_session()
session.set_critical(True)  # Enables ECS task protection

try:
    # Perform critical video processing
    results = await process_video_artifacts_unified(...)
finally:
    # Always clean up - removes protection when complete
    session.set_critical(False)
    session.cleanup()
```

## Benefits

1. **No Data Loss**: Critical processing cannot be interrupted by ECS task termination
2. **Automatic Management**: Protection is managed automatically based on processing state
3. **Gap-Free Protection**: Mathematical guarantee that no timing gaps can occur
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Respects ongoing work while allowing clean application exit
5. **Emergency Override**: Force disable available for controlled shutdowns
6. **Full Observability**: Comprehensive status monitoring and logging

## Deployment Considerations

- Set `ECS_ENABLE_TASK_PROTECTION=true` environment variable in ECS task definition
- Ensure ECS service has appropriate IAM permissions for task protection APIs
- Monitor protection duration to prevent indefinite protection (1-hour maximum built-in)
- Configure health checks to work with extended task protection periods

The implementation ensures that ECS tasks running critical video processing operations cannot be terminated prematurely, while still allowing for graceful shutdowns when processing is complete.
